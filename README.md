# School Management System (Tkinter + SQLite + Excel)

A role-based school management system built with Python, Tkinter, SQLite, and Pandas for Excel export.

This desktop app allows **Admins**, **Teachers**, and **Students** to manage and view school-related data including teacher records, student profiles, homework, announcements, and exam results â€” with support for downloading student results as Excel files.

## Result Export to Excel

- Teachers can download student results as `.xlsx` files
- Current storage is in Excel (e.g., `studata.xlsx`), but can be migrated to SQLite
- Simple Tkinter button triggers file save dialog and Excel file export using Pandas

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Run the app**

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Choose role** and login with credentials

---

## Database Schema (SQLite: `school.db`)

- `teachers` table: stores teacher info (id, name, email, assigned class/section)
- `students_<class>_<section>` tables: dynamic tables per class-section storing student data

---

## Dependencies

- `tkinter` â€” GUI framework
- `pandas` â€” Excel file handling
- `openpyxl` â€” Excel read/write backend for pandas
- `sqlite3` â€” embedded database for user and student data

---

## Future Roadmap

- Move all student result data from Excel into SQLite for consistency and scalability
- Implement student-side result downloads
- Add password reset functionality
- Improve UI with Tkinter's ttk styling and better UX
- Add detailed Excel formatting (subject-wise, class-wise sheets)
